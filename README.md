## Overview

The Automated Machine Learning Pipeline is an orchestrated experiment designed to streamline the entire ML workflow from data collection to model deployment. It ensures reproducibility, consistency, and validation of ML models. The pipeline has been designed with six stages that can be executed sequentially.

# Online Delivery Predictions - README

Welcome to the **Online Delivery Predictions** project! This project aims to predict the time taken for food deliveries based on a variety of factors, including geographic information, traffic conditions, weather, and more. Below, you'll find a detailed explanation of the project structure, steps involved, and the overall pipeline used to achieve accurate delivery time predictions.

---

## Project Overview

In this project, we predict the **Time_taken (min)** for food deliveries using the following features:

- Delivery personnel information (age, ratings, multiple deliveries)
- Geographic data (restaurant and delivery location coordinates)
- Weather and road conditions
- Type of vehicle and type of order
- City and festival indicators

### Key Features
- **Restaurant and Delivery Coordinates**: Using latitude and longitude values to calculate the distance between the restaurant and the delivery location.
- **Weather and Traffic**: These real-time conditions directly influence the delivery time.
- **Vehicle Condition**: The condition of the delivery vehicle also impacts the delivery speed.
  
### Target Variable
- **Time_taken (min)**: The total time taken for each delivery, which serves as the target variable for our prediction model.

## Project Pipeline

The project is structured into three stages, each stage focusing on a different part of the machine learning pipeline. Below is a summary of each stage:

---

### --> STAGE 1 <--

**Goal**: Data Ingestion and Preprocessing

1. **Constant File**: This file contains all necessary directories and paths for the project.
   
2. **Configuration File**: The configuration file merges all the necessary directories and path settings required for ingestion and storage.

3. **Data Ingestion**: This script handles loading, splitting, and saving the data in the artifacts folder. It ensures that the data is correctly partitioned into training, validation, and test sets.

---

### --> STAGE 2 <--

**Goal**: Data Transformation and Preparation

1. **Constant File**: Directory and constant settings required for transformation.
   
2. **Configuration File**: Handles the configuration for the data transformation steps.
   
3. **Data Transformation**: The script applies all necessary transformations such as:
   - Handling missing values
   - Normalization and scaling of numerical features
   - Encoding of categorical features (e.g., weather, traffic conditions)

4. **Utils File**: Contains helper functions to streamline the data transformation process, used if needed during transformation.

---

### --> STAGE 3 <--

**Goal**: Model Training and Evaluation

1. **Constant File**: Contains model-related directories and constants.
   
2. **Configuration File**: Specifies model hyperparameters, paths for saving models, and evaluation metrics.

3. **Model Training**: The script handles the training of different models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, etc.) to predict the delivery time. It also includes cross-validation steps to ensure model generalizability.

4. **Utils File**: Contains helper functions related to model evaluation and saving results, such as metrics calculation (RMSE, MAE, etc.) and model persistence.

---

### Key Files and Directories

1. **artifacts/**: Stores all generated artifacts, such as trained models, processed data, and predictions.
2. **constants/**: Holds files related to constants such as directory paths.
3. **configs/**: Contains configuration files for each stage (data ingestion, transformation, and model training).
4. **utils/**: Utility functions that assist in data handling, model evaluation, and more.
5. **data/**: Contains raw and split datasets.
6. **models/**: Stores trained models and results.

---

### Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - **pandas** for data manipulation
  - **scikit-learn** for model training and evaluation
  - **folium** for map visualizations
  - **NumPy** for numerical operations
  - **Matplotlib** for plotting data insights
  - **joblib** for saving and loading trained models

## Installation and Usage

To run this project, you'll need to install the necessary Python libraries.

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/online-delivery-predictions.git
   cd online-delivery-predictions
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the pipeline**:

   Each stage can be run independently by executing the respective scripts located in the `src/` folder. For example:

   ```bash
   python src/data_ingestion.py
   python src/data_transformation.py
   python src/model_training.py
   ```

4. **Check artifacts**:

   After execution, the outputs (processed data, models) will be available in the `artifacts/` folder.

## Future Improvements

- **Model Optimization**: Fine-tuning the model with more advanced techniques like hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV or RandomSearchCV.
- **Feature Engineering**: Adding more sophisticated features such as traffic prediction models or real-time weather data could improve the delivery time prediction accuracy.
- **Deployment**: The model can be deployed using tools like **Flask** or **FastAPI** for real-time predictions in a production environment.
