# Automated Machine Learning Pipeline

This project implements an end-to-end automated pipeline that orchestrates the entire Machine Learning (ML) process, from data extraction to deployment, leveraging an S3 bucket for data storage and a model registry for model validation.

## Overview

The Automated Machine Learning Pipeline is an orchestrated experiment designed to streamline the entire ML workflow from data collection to model deployment. It ensures reproducibility, consistency, and validation of ML models. The pipeline has been designed with six stages that can be executed sequentially.

## Pipeline Stages

### Stage 1: Data Extraction

- **Objective**: Fetch data from any server to a local system.
- **Input**: Data is extracted from an S3 bucket or any other remote data storage location.
- **Output**: Data is saved locally, for example, `data.csv`.
- **Tools**: AWS SDK (e.g., Boto3), Python `pandas`.

```python
# Example code for data extraction from S3
import boto3

s3 = boto3.client('s3')
s3.download_file('my_bucket', 'data.csv', 'local_data.csv')
```

### Stage 2: Data Analysis

- **Objective**: Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), handle missing values, and impute or remove null values.
- **Tasks**: 
  - Visualize data distributions.
  - Handle missing values, outliers, and skewed data.
  - Generate summary statistics.
- **Output**: Cleaned dataset.
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`.

```python
# Example code for handling missing values
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('local_data.csv')
df.fillna(df.mean(), inplace=True)  # Imputing missing values
```

### Stage 3: Data Validation

- **Objective**: Verify if the dataset meets the expectations for modeling.
- **Tasks**:
  - Ensure the dataset contains 12 features (5 categorical, 5 numerical, and 2 float).
  - Check column names, data types, and other structural requirements.
- **Output**: Validation report.
- **Tools**: Python `pandas`.

```python
# Example code for validating features
expected_features = {'Category1': 'object', 'Category2': 'object', 
                     'Num1': 'int64', 'Num2': 'int64', 'Float1': 'float64'}

for column, dtype in expected_features.items():
    assert df[column].dtype == dtype, f"Feature {column} has incorrect type!"
```

### Stage 4: Data Preparation

- **Objective**: Perform feature engineering and data transformation.
- **Tasks**: 
  - Transform categorical variables using one-hot encoding or label encoding.
  - Scale numerical features.
  - Generate new features based on domain knowledge.
- **Output**: Transformed dataset ready for modeling.
- **Tools**: `sklearn`, `pandas`.

```python
# Example code for feature engineering
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, LabelEncoder

# Example: Scaling numeric features
scaler = StandardScaler()
df[['Num1', 'Num2']] = scaler.fit_transform(df[['Num1', 'Num2']])

# Example: Encoding categorical features
encoder = LabelEncoder()
df['Category1'] = encoder.fit_transform(df['Category1'])
```

### Stage 5: Model Training, Evaluation & Validation

- **Objective**: Train the model, evaluate its performance, and store the validation results in a model registry.
- **Tasks**: 
  - Split the data into training and testing sets.
  - Train the model using appropriate algorithms.
  - Evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, etc.
  - Store the trained model in a model registry for future validation.
- **Output**: Trained and validated model.
- **Tools**: `sklearn`, `mlflow`, `pandas`.

```python
# Example code for model training and validation
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Model evaluation
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)}")
```

### Stage 6: Deployment

- **Objective**: Deploy the model into a production environment.
- **Tasks**: 
  - Deploy the model to a web service or cloud platform.
  - Expose the model through an API for real-time predictions.
- **Output**: Live model serving predictions.
- **Tools**: AWS Lambda, Flask, FastAPI.

```python
# Example code for deploying a model with Flask
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict():
    data = request.get_json()
    prediction = model.predict([data['features']])
    return jsonify({'prediction': prediction.tolist()})
```

## Environments

### Beta Testing
This environment is used for experimentation and development, and includes the following stages:
- **Experimentation**: Early-stage data experimentation and model prototyping.
- **Development**: Refining the pipeline and preparing the model for testing.
- **Test**: Running the pipeline in a controlled test environment.

### Final Launch
This environment is for the final stages before and after the model is put into production:
- **Staging**: Preproduction testing with production-like data.
- **Preproduction**: Verifying model performance in real-world conditions.
- **Production**: Final deployment of the model into a live environment.

## Model Registry

The **Model Registry** is a centralized storage system where validated models are stored after training. It helps keep track of model versions, validation metrics, and deployment readiness.

Tools like **MLflow** can be used to manage model registration, track experiments, and automate versioning.

```python
import mlflow
mlflow.log_param("model_type", "RandomForest")
mlflow.log_metric("accuracy", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, "model")
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/automated-ml-pipeline.git
   ```
2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the pipeline**: 
   You can trigger the entire pipeline by executing the main script.
   ```bash
   python run_pipeline.py
   ```
2. **View experiment results**: 
   Results are logged and stored in `mlflow` or any logging tool you configure.
